          <p>A computer is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, store, and output data. Data is information such as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or a sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform. Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved in a storage device, shown on a display, or sent to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form a network such as the internet, allowing the computers to communicate with each other.

            The processor of a computer is made from integrated circuits (chips) that contains many transistors. Most computers are digital, which means that they represent information by using binary digits, or bits. Computers come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand and model and purpose. They range from small computers such as smartphones and laptops, to large computers such as supercomputers........

          <img src="images/body/intel.jpg" alt="1st-pc.jpg" height="200" width="250" class="b">
          <p>The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. It was the first commercially produced microprocessor,[2] and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs.

            The chip design, implemented with the MOS silicon gate technology, started in April 1970, and was created by Federico Faggin who led the project from beginning to completion in 1971. Marcian Hoff formulated and led the architectural proposal in 1969, and Masatoshi Shima contributed to the architecture and later to the logic design. The first delivery of a fully operational 4004 occurred in March 1971 to Busicom Corp. of Japan for its 141-PF printing calculator engineering prototype (now displayed in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California).[3] This calculator for which the 4004 was originally designed and built as a custom chip[4] was first commercially available in July 1971.Federico Faggin accomplished what no one had achieved before: to fit a general-purpose CPU into a small, commercial silicon chip........

          <p>The development of electrical systems is a long and winding story which I have been researching for some 48 years. From the arc light systems, now forgotten, which played a major role; to the incandescent light systems of Edison and his competitors; through the development of power systems in the 20th century, much has been lost or forgotten. For example, the DC transmission concepts of Rene Thury are all but gone from most reference sources, as are those of later HVDC pioneers.
            When it comes to polyphase AC, it appears that there is no true "father," but rather a number of researchers. William Stanley, the inventor of the transformer in the US was funded by George Westinghouse, an industrialist in railway air brake and signal systems who sought to improve upon the limitations of the DC systems.In Germany, Werner Siemens and others took the lead and produced the first long distance transmission of AC power 1891. AC motors were a different matter and the two leading figures on opposite sides of the Atlantic approached .......

          <img src="images/body/1st-tv.jpg" alt="1st-pc.jpg" height="200" width="250" class="b">
          <p>There is not an easy answer to who invented the television. The idea of having something that transmits moving images existed long before the first television was built. In the late 19th century, a couple of scientists made pivotal discoveries, without which the first television would not have existed. In the 1920s, over 50 inventors from Japan, Britain, Germany, America and Russia were all seriously attempting to build televisions, many of which had very promising demonstrations.

            First Mechanical Television
            If one regards the definition of “television” to be the live transmission of images with continuing variation in tone, the credit to who invented the television belongs to Scottish engineer John Logie Baird. He built and and demonstrated the world’s first mechanical television. Baird also invented and demonstrated the first color television in public as well as the first electronic color television picture tube.........

          <h2>World first Air Conditioner</h2>
          <img src="images/body/1st-ac.jpg" alt="1st-pc.jpg" height="200" width="250" class="b"">
          <p>In the early 70s, cooling/heating type air conditioners had a limited heating capacity and most of them needed auxiliary heaters in their indoor units to complement their heating capacity.

            As energy-saving awareness rose in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, the emergence of new technology was long awaited for reducing energy loss by a continuous control of compressor capacity so that the conventional on-off control for temperature adjustment was to be replaced. Many had predicted that the use of an inverter, or frequency converter, would be an optimal　choice to serve the purpose, but inverters in those days were too large and expensive to be built into air conditioners. Despite these challenges, Toshiba, with a state-of-the-art high-power transistor and microprocessor-controlled sinusoidal pulse width modulation, achieved a significant downsizing in its inverters. An inverter whose size and weight was only one-sixth that of a conventional inverter, was instrumental in Toshiba's launch of the world's first air conditioner for commercial use in December 1980.........

          <p>Ultimately, Simon fell victim to the relentless march of technology, which saw the advent of the flip phone in the mid 1990s, the dominance of Nokia throughout the early part of the 21st century and the emergence of internet-enabled phones akin to the smartphones of today.

            Over the past decade, a handful of players, including Samsung, Apple and Huawei, have risen to control the smartphone market, particularly in the West and large parts of Asia.
            
            Around 2.5 billion of us now own a smartphone, and this figure is predicted to rise to almost three billion by 2020. Our insatiable appetite for technology has helped fuel China’s emergence as a production powerhouse. Last year alone, it manufactured over 186 million smartphones.........

          <video src="video/Me at the zoo.mkv" autoplay="autoplay" height="200" width="250" class="b" ></video>
          <p>The first ever YouTube video was uploaded on April 23, 2005 -- exactly 15 years ago, today.
            YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the 18-second video, titled "Me at the zoo." It has since garnered over 90 million views. To this day, it is the only video on Karim's channel.
            Upon clicking play, the screen fills with a young Karim's face, his disheveled hair taking up the screen front and center.
            "Alright," Karim begins. "So here we are, in front of the elephants."There he is. In front of the elephants.
            "The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long, um, trunks," he continues. "And that's, that's cool."
            So. True.
            Unlike many YouTube creators' videos these days, Karim's video does not include what's considered the more traditional sign off: "Subscribe to my channel!" or "Like, rate, comment!"
            He ends the video simply by stating: "And that's pretty much all there is to say."
            A year after "Me at the zoo," Karim and fellow co-founders sold the platform to Google for a whopping $1.65 billion.........

          <audio src="audio/morse.wav" controls="controls" class="b"></audio>
          <p>In 1844, Morse sent his first telegraph message, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland; by 1866, a telegraph line had been laid across the Atlantic Ocean from the U.S. to Europe.

            how was Morse code used in the past? Morse Code was used to send messages over long distances. Morse code messages can be sent using light or by pulses. Eventually, when Morse Code was adapted to radio, the dots and dashes began being referred to as "dits" and "dahs" based on the sound of the radio pulses.
            
            Accordingly, what was the first message sent by Morse code?
            
            Sent by inventor Samuel F.B. Morse on May 24, 1844, over an experimental line from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, the message said: "What hath God wrought?" Taken from the Bible, Numbers 23:23, and recorded on a paper tape, the phrase had been suggested to Morse by Annie Ellsworth, the young daughter of a friend..........
